/**
 * The PATH entry through which an Kingu-launched child reaches THIS app's own CLI.
 *
 * Extracted from `buildPtyHostEnv` so the structured-session lane can apply the identical
 * treatment. A structured worker has no PTY, but its provider child runs `kingu orchestration ...`
 * exactly like a PTY worker's agent does, and it was inheriting the ambient PATH instead. On
 * packaged Linux that made bare `kingu` resolve to GNOME's /usr/bin/kingu screen reader, because
 * Kingu's Linux CLI installs as `kingu-ide` to avoid claiming that name (anthovai/kingu-intelligence#7904); on
 * packaged macOS/Windows it reached this app's bundled CLI only if the user had separately
 * registered the CLI globally.
 *
 * `platform` is a test seam only: production leaves it unset and reads `process.platform`, so
 * every branch behaves exactly as it did inside `buildPtyHostEnv`.
