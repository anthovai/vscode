/**
 * Every skill transaction stages a path as a hidden sibling before touching it,
 * and those siblings land directly in a scanned discovery root. Discovery must
 * not surface them, or a skill mid-transaction shows up as a second row (and,
 * for delete, as a row the user can delete again).
 *
 * The four conventions in the tree today:
 *   `.<name>.kingu-skill-delete-<uuid>`      (service)
 *   `.<name>.kingu-remove-backup-<uuid>`     (skill-remove-transaction)
 *   `.<name>.kingu-placement-backup-<id>`    (skill-placement-transaction-controller)
 *   `.<name>.kingu-placement-staging-<id>`   (skill-placement-transaction-controller)
 *
 * Matched by shape rather than by an enumerated list so the native walker and
 * WSL's `find -prune` (which can only express a glob) cannot drift apart.
